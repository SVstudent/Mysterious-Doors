# Mysterious-Doors
Hello!This is my CodeDay project for the theme of "What if?". But, I might turn it in a bit late.
I made it so it would challenge me and so that I could have fun. It's still in-progress, but when I'm completely done I will update the project.



------- Game -----------
- The game is pretty simple where you are faced with a situation(scenario) where you are in trouble and have to choose the correct door to escape.
- You will need to move your mouse onto the bubble that is next to the door you chose. That is why it is a theme-based game of "what if?"
- !!!!!Pending WORK!!!!!!
- I will have to add more than one scenarios so there are several and you will be brought to the other scenarios right after you completed the scenario you started at.
- More Polishing
- That's it for now.
